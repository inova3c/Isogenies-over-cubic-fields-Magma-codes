This repository contains Magma code related to the computations in the paper:
Degrees of isogenies over prime degree number fields of non-CM elliptic curves with rational j-invariant
https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03062

The version of Magma that was used is V2.28-3


The file "gl2data" is a list of all possible 2-adic Galois representations, due to Zureick and Brown. This file is needed to run some of the code. 

For each of the files, the square brackets contain the result from the paper which uses it.
