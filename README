This repository contains Magma code related to the computations in the paper:
Degrees of isogenies over prime degree number fields of non-CM elliptic curves with rational j-invariant
https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03062

The version of Magma that was used is V2.28-3

To run some of the code, the file gl2data.txt is needed. For each of the programs, the square brackets contain the result from the paper which uses it.
